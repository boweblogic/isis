== Related Mixins and Menus

The service's functionality is exposed in the UI through a mixin (per object) and a menu action (for all objects):

* the xref:applib-classes:mixins.adoc#java-lang-object[Object] mixin provides the ability to download the XML layout for any domain object (entity or view model).

* the `LayoutServiceMenu` provides the ability to download all XML layouts as a single ZIP file (in any of the three styles).

The XML can then be copied into the codebase of the application, and annotations in the domain classes removed as desired.

=== Styles

Each of these actions take as a parameter an instance of xref:refguide:applib:index/services/layout/Style.adoc[Style].

The `CURRENT` style corresponds to the layout already loaded for the domain class, typically from an already persisted `layout.xml` file.
The other three styles allow the developer to choose how much metadata is to be specified in the XML, and how much (if any) will be obtained elsewhere, typically from annotations in the metamodel.
The table below summarises the choices:

As a developer, you therefore have a choice as to how you provide the metadata required for customised layouts:

* if you want all layout metadata to be read from the `.layout.xml` file, then download the "complete" version, and copy the file alongside the domain class.
+
You can then remove all `@MemberOrder`, `@ActionLayout`, `@PropertyLayout` and `@CollectionLayout` annotations from the source code of the domain class.

* if you want to use layout XML file to describe the grid (columns, tabs etc) and specify which object members are associated with those regions of the grid, then download the "normalized" version.
+
You can then remove the `@MemberOrder` annotations from the source code of the domain class, but retain the `@ActionLayout`, `@PropertyLayout` and `@CollectionLayout` annotations.

* if you want to use layout XML file ONLY to describe the grid, then download the "minimal" version.
+
The grid regions will be empty in this version, and the framework will use the `@MemberOrder` annotation to bind object members to those regions.

The functionality of `LayoutService` is surfaced in the user interface through a related xref:refguide:applib:index/services/layout/LayoutService.adoc#related-mixins-and-menus[mixin and menu action].
See also xref:refguide:applib:index/services/layout/Style.adoc[Style], which determines how much data is included in the downloaded XML.

The xref:refguide:applib:index/services/grid/GridService.adoc[GridService] is responsible for loading and normalizing layout XML for a domain class.
It in turn uses the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/grid/GridLoaderService.adoc[GridLoaderService] and  xref:refguide:applib:index/services/grid/GridSystemService.adoc[GridSystemService]
services.
