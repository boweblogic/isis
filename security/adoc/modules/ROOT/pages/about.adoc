This guide describes the authentication and authorization features available to secure your Apache Isis application.



== Terminology

Apache Isis has built-in support for authentication and authorization:

* By "authentication" we mean logging into the application using some credentials, typically a username and password.
Authentication also means looking up the set of roles to which a user belongs.
+
The framework allows for different authentication mechanisms through the xref:refguide:core:index/security/authentication/Authenticator.adoc[Authenticator] SPI.
.

* By "authorization" we mean permissions: granting roles to have access to features (domain object members) of the app.
+
The framework allows for different authorization mechanisms through the xref:refguide:core:index/security/authorization/Authorizor.adoc[Authorizor] SPI.

There are two levels of permissions:

* _Read_ permission means that the user can view the object member; it will be rendered in the UI.
+
An action with only read permission will be shown disabled ("greyed out"); a property with read-only permission cannot be edited.

* _Write_ permission means that the object member can be changed.
+
For actions this means that they can be invoked.

If there is neither _read_ nor _write_ permissions then the feature will be invisible to the user.

[NOTE]
.What about auditing?
====
A further aspect of security is auditing: recording what data was modified by which user.

Apache Isis provides the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/iactn/InteractionContext.adoc[InteractionContext] can be used to track the actions being invoked, and the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/spi/EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber.adoc[EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber] captures what data was modified as a result (auditing).
When ``Interaction``s are persisted (eg by way of the xref:mappings:outbox-publisher:about.adoc[Outbox Publisher] mapping module) then this provides excellent traceability.
The xref:security:audit-trail:about.adoc[Audit Trail] module provides an implementation of the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/spi/EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber.adoc[EntityPropertyChangeSubscriber] that persists audit entries to the database.

For xref:refguide:applib:index/services/publishing/spi/CommandSubscriber.adoc[CommandSubscriber] SPI can be also be used to capture actions.
The xref:extensions:command-log:about.adoc[Command Log] extension provides a simple implementation of this SPI.

== Implementations

[#shiro]
=== Shiro

The framework provides an API for both authentication and authorization, and provides an implementation that integrates with link:http://shiro.apache.org[Apache Shiro].
Shiro in turn uses the concept of a _realm_ as a source for both authentication and optionally authorization.

Shiro ships with a simple text-based realm -- the `IniRealm` -- which reads users (and password), user roles and role permissions from the `WEB-INF/shiro.ini` file.
The xref:docs:starters:helloworld.adoc[HelloWorld] and xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[SimpleApp] starter apps are both configured to use this realm.

The Shiro framework ships with an implementation of an LDAP-based realm; LDAP is often used to manage user/passwords and corresponding user groups.
Apache Isis extends Shiro's implementation this  `IsisLdapRealm`, which provides more flexibility for both group/role and role/permissions management.


=== Bypass

The framework provides a "bypass" implementation, useful for quick-n-dirty prototyping when you want to in effect disable (bypass) security completely.

=== KeyCloak

=== Spring

WARNING: TODO: v2 - WIP, to document

== SecMan

The xref:security:ROOT:about.adoc[SecMan extension]'s primary purpose is for authorisation, defining a database of roles and permissions associated with
those roles.
It also maps users to roles.

As these users, roles and permissions are domain objects, they can be administered through Apache Isis itself.

Because each user to be authorised must exist in the SecMan database, this means that it can also act as a secondary authenticator.
It does this by providing an implementation of the Shiro `Realm` API.
Using this design the password management can be handled to a subsidiary (delegate) Shiro realm (for example, LDAP, as discussed <<shiro, above>>).
